# Copy and Backup

**New scripting project.**
I wrote some batch scripting to automate a repetive task in my daily job.

I handle multiple projects all througout the year.\
Each project generate sensitive data that needs to be copied and backup in different location on a remote server.\
Manual copy and watching over the job can become a very annoying task.\
Thus, this series of script to automate this process.

**The scripts are Batch scripts.**
I call all other scripts from the main script where selections are handled.\
Obviously bacth is the quickest option I can implement giving internal IT restrictions I will face on my work computer.

I would like to accomplish the same in the near future in my python learning journey.\
*I actually started this project on python*
