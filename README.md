# Copy and Backup

New scripting project
I wrote some batch scripting to automate a repetive task in my daily job.
I handle multiple projects all througout the year.
Each project generate sensitive data that needs to be copied and backup in different location on a remote server.
Manual copy and watching over the job can become a very annoying task.
Thus, this series of script to automate this process.
