# Copy and Backup

New scripting project
I wrote some batch scripting to automate a repetive task in my daily job.
I handle multiple projects all througout the year.
Each project generate sensitive data that needs to be copied and backup in different location on a remote server.
Manual copy and watching over the job can become a very annoying task.
Thus, this series of script to automate this process.

The scripts are Batch scripts.
obviously it's the only way for me to get this done with the ton of IT restriction I will face on my work computer since I'm not part of the IT and or Best Practice Team.
I've tried this same project in my basic python learning and added them in a different repository.
